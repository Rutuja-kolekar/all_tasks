        <h1>This is box model</h1>
        <p>   This is a box model which is created by using <b>div</b> tag.Div tag is used to separation. it is a non-syemmentic tag 
        because we can't tell accurate that which data we are going to define in div tag.
        <b> padding,content and margin</b> are the three main parts of the box model 
            <b>Padding</b> is lies between content and border.
            <b>Content</b> is inner side of the padding. 
            <b>Border</b>  telling us the scope of box .
            <b>Margin</b>  is a area of the outside of the border.
